# Vulnerability-Assement-Report
Artemis Financial consulting company develops individualized financial plan for saving, retirement, investment, and insurance for their patrons. They want to modernize their operation and implement the most current and effective software security. There are seeking to add file verification step to their application to ensure secure communication. When the web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum.

I approached customer need by analyzing the requirements first to understand what the customers want. I did a static testing by using dependency check tool to analyze vulnerability on the web application.

 It is important to code securely to prevent unauthorized entities accessing the code repository, avoiding data breaches, build a robust software, protect customers and business data from hackers and maintain the reputation of the business.
 The challenge I had working through the vulnerability assessment was how to identify the false positive and the false negative, and how to patch the vulnerability found in the html vulnerability report. 
 
 To increase the layer of security, a secure data communication was established by converting the http to https protocol, a vulnerability dependency check and code review were also made to ensure that the update compile, and data ware encrypted.
The resources that I used were OWASP dependency check maven, I used java keytool to generate a certificate, I looked at java algorithm name to recommend an appropriate encryption algorithm cipher to used in the web application.
